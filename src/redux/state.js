        lyrics: `Aza mba manody hono ny fo tsy mahay mitia
        Amiko fanafody aza ny fisinao tety
        Nanansitrana,nitondra vintana
        Namelona fihetseham-po,tsy hay faritana
        Nisy masoandro mamiratra hono ny tanàna
        Lasa nahafinaritra toa nahatamana
        Masonao mijery toa feno fahagagana
        Lasanao ilay foko fa tsy tana
        
        Dia nataoko hirahira fa tsy haritro
        Ny tsy hikitika ny tanako ny fiainanao
        Raha mba ianao iny no lasa vadiko
        Dia feno antsika roa izao tontolo izao
        Rahovina ihany vao ho tanteraka
        Ilay faniriako efa elabe
        Fenoko vinany,fenoko mozika
        Raha tena ho avy izany
        Mba faniriako anie ry malala
        Tsy hanampetra ny antsika roa fa ho mandramaty
        Tsy ho ravan’ny taona,ho mafy orina
        Eny ho lamban’akoho ka faty no hisarahana
        Oh ry tsy foiko,ianao ilay tsy mahafoy ahy
        Iriako ho lafatra ilay fitia na dia tsy tomombana
        Izay no mba ventsom-poko ka manokaloiko
        Satria malalako ianao
        Oh malala oh,iaraha malala oh
        Fa izaho tena tia efa hainao satria
        Raha tsy nisy fo mitempo aho tsy tonga taty
        Oh malala oh,iaraha malala oh
        Fa izaho tena tia efa hainao satria
        Raha tsy nisy fo mitempo aho tsy tonga taty
        Mety ho sarotra,mety ho lava ,mety hanonja ny dia
        Tsy ho lavitra fahavalo mety hisopatra akie
        Fa ny tanjontsika iray ihany
        Izay hisy anao de ho eo koa izaho
        K a andeha re ry aiko hiaraka hamakivaky
        Hatsiaka sy oram-baratra,iaraha-miafy
        Hifampitsinjo n’aiza n’aiza haleha
        Ka hiara-sambatra eo akaikinao aho

        Dia nataoko hirahira fa tsy haritro
        Ny tsy hikitika ny tanako ny fiainanao
        Raha mba ianao iny no lasa vadiko
        Dia feno antsika roa izao tontolo izao

        Tsy ho ravan’ny taona,ho mafy orina

        You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
